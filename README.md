# Article Website

This is a simple article website project that showcases three main pages - a main index page that displays an intro and a list of articles, an article page that displays a single article, and a new article page that allows users to create a new article. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (and node Js soon)

## Main Index Page
The main index page (`index.html`) displays an introduction about the website and a list of articles. Each article is represented as a card with a title, a short description, and a "Read More" link/button. Users can click on the "Read Now" link/button to view the full article on the article page.

## Article Page
The article page (`article.html`) displays a single article with a title, a date, and the full content of the article. Users can navigate to this page by clicking on the "Read Now" link/button on the main index page.

## New Article Page
The new article page (`new_article.html`) allows users to create a new article. It contains a form with fields for entering the title, and content of the article. Users can submit the form to add a new article to the website. The form uses JavaScript to validate user input and ensure that all required fields are filled out.
